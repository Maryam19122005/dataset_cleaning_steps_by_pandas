# dataset_cleaning_steps_by_pandas
# The Netflix dataset was cleaned by removing columns with too many missing values, filling gaps in key fields with the most common value, converting dates, and removing duplicates. Columns were renamed for clarity, duration was split into value and unit, text was standardized, and new date-based columns were added. The cleaned data was saved as a new CSV, and missing values were visualized with a heatmap.
